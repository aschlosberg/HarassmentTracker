The harassment tracker is a service to raise awareness of sexual harassment on the streets. A simple reporting service, with sufficient usage it will allow governments and police departments to implement data-driven safety initiatives and test their efficacy.

A hosted version of the interface is currently available at https://aschlosberg.github.io/HarassmentTracker/
